# PotatoMC
Potato MC is a Minecraft modpack that should be able to run on a literal potato which is its goal. Hopefully we will be able to achieve this goal so we took the weakest and strongest performance mods we could find and tested them all and merged them into one and slowly Potato MC found a list of mods that where strong and slowly we hope to have one the most powerful performance modpacks there is. So come and try it out if you don't like it or find a set of mods that are better let us know so we can create a modpack that truly shows the power of your PC.

All the mods in the pack are credited to their creators, they did all the dirty work and you should support them. This modpack was made by just two guys that wanted to optimize Minecraft.

This will be the repository fopr people to be able to help add onto the modpack to help with its optimizations.
